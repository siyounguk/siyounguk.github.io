            <h3>Pub Hop</h3>
          </header>
          <p>
            Pub Hop is designed as a mobile web app for pub and walking / sightseeing enthusiasts.<br>
            This is an app using Google Maps where users can login and search for routes located within a particular area and follow the route. Users can also create and upload their own curated walks.
            I used a MEAN stack for this project and particularly enjoyed using the Google Maps / Places API in making this app. I am happy how this work has turned out and I look forward to continuing to expand the project into using geolocation and adding more detail to the routes.

            <h3>Pet Sitters</h3>
          </header>
          <p>
            Wanting one's pets to be cared for by someone else who loves pets is often a concern for people leaving their home for a short period of time. Pet Sitters aims to alleviate this issue by providing a service for homeowners seeking carers for their pets and people looking for a stay in a home with pets. As a member of Pet Sitters sitters are able to search for and contact potential homeowners for a stay and vice versa enabling users to get in contact with each other.<br>

            <h3>The Rorschach Memory Test</h3>
          </header>
          <p>
            This project is a twist on the classic game of memory. The players are faced with a selection of overturned cards. The front of each card represents half of an image based on the Rorschach test. If a player gets a correct match the full image is displayed on their board and they get another go. If theuy don't get a match it is then the next player's turn.
