      <p>Having completed the Immersive Web Development course with General Assembly in London I have been working primarily as a Front-end Developer for Chroma Sports since March 2016. 
         Changing careers has proven to be the best professional decision I have ever made.<br />
         I am eager to continue my advancement in the industry through facing new challenges and honing my current skills as a Web Developer as well as learning and picking up new techniques and technologies.</p>

              <h4>03/2016 - Present</h4>
            </header>
            <p> I started working as a Front-end Developer for Chroma working on the company’s white label fantasy games platform helping to develop games for companies such as The Irish Times, Barclays, Greene King and a range of international broadcast and news media clients. As time has gone on I have also worked closely with designers, product owners and other developers in the creating new functionality tailored to specific client's needs.
I begun working in HTML5 / CSS3 and JavaScript / jQuery and have furthered my skills in these disciplines. More recently I have been involved in a variety of projects including developing a new games platform (using ReactJS and SASS) using mobile-first design principles. </p>

              <h3>Senior Loan Operations Officer, CA-CIB, London</h3><h4>09/10 - 08/14</h4>
            </header>
            <p>This role as well as the other Loans Operations jobs I had in the past required a high level in
              accuracy as I was administering loan requests for large amounts of money and had to make sure
              that the proper documentation was in place for the booking of the loans. I also had to communicate
              the loan requests in a timely and accurate fashion with the Treasury Department who would then
              borrow or lend money on the Stock Market based on the information I provided.

            </p>
            <p>
              During this role I was able to get an opportunity to work on IT projects from a user perspective,
              such as helping with the enhancement of the Bank’s in-house loans management tool as well as
              the loan booking program. This gave me an insight into and interest in software development.

      <h2>A little more...</h2>
      <p> In my role with Credit Agricole, I was given the opportunity to learn Spanish and consolidated this
        further during my time in South America. I hope to further my language skills. I have a keen
        interest in visual arts and media, especially film. My degree in Media enabled me to enhance my
        passion for film and culture to be able to appreciate Media from a critical perspective. I am also a
        fan of music and enjoy playing guitar. When working as part of a band I enjoy the creative process
        and evolving a song from the initial idea to its realisation.
