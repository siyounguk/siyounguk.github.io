To see and be part of an evolving project is very rewarding.</p>

            <p>This role as well as the other Loans Operations jobs I had in the past required a high level in accuracy as I was administering corporate loan requests.

      <h2>A little more...</h2>
      <p> In my role with Credit Agricole, I was able to learn Spanish and consolidated this further during my time in South America. I hope to further improve this. I have a keen interest in visual media, especially film. my degree in Media enabled me to enhance my passion for film and culture to be able to  appreciate Media from a critical perspective. I’m also a fan of music and enjoy playing guitar myself. I enjoy creating something collectively from the ground up and seeing a song evolve.</p>
