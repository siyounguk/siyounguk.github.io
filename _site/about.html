      <p> I turned to Web Development after several years working in Loans Operations and trying my hand at teaching English.<br> So far this appears to be the best professional decision I've made as I love the continuous challenges and learning that comes with Web Development. To see and be part of an evolving project is very rewarding.</p>

              <h3>Senior Loan Operations Officer, CA-CIB, London</h3><h4>09/10 - 08/14</h4>
            </header>
            <p>This role as well as the other Loans Operations jobs I had in the past required a high level in
              accuracy as I was administering loan requests for large amounts of money and had to make sure 
              that the proper documentation was in place for the booking of the loans. I also had to communicate 
              the loan requests in a timely and accurate fashion with the Treasury Department who would then 
              borrow or lend money on the Stock Market based on the information I provided.
              
            </p>
            <p>
              During this role I was able to get an opportunity to work on IT projects from a user perspective, 
              such as helping with the enhancement of the Bank’s in-house loans management tool as well as 
              the loan booking program. This gave me an insight into and interest in software development.

      <h2>A little more...</h2>
      <p> In my role with Credit Agricole, I was given the opportunity to learn Spanish and consolidated this
        further during my time in South America. I hope to further my language skills. I have a keen 
        interest in visual arts and media, especially film. My degree in Media enabled me to enhance my 
        passion for film and culture to be able to appreciate Media from a critical perspective. I am also a 
        fan of music and enjoy playing guitar. When working as part of a band I enjoy the creative process 
        and evolving a song from the initial idea to its realisation.
